      <h1>Stakeholder lens</h1>
      <p class="hero-subtitle">Each team reads the plan through a different stakeholder's eyes. A donor reads differently than a frontline employee. A community member reads differently than a board member. The gaps between their perspectives reveal blind spots.</p>

      <h2>Why perspective matters</h2>
      <p>Strategic plans are usually written by insiders for insiders. But the plan's success depends on people who weren't in the room: community members, funders, partners, new hires, the public. This game forces your team to temporarily abandon their own viewpoint and read the plan as someone else would.</p>

      <p>The result: you discover what's unclear, what's missing, and what accidentally excludes or alienates the people you're trying to serve.</p>

          <h3>The report template</h3>
          <p>Give each team this framework for their persona's evaluation:</p>
          <div class="card" style="margin: var(--space-md) 0;">
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>"As a [persona], reading this plan..."</strong></p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 1.2rem;">
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>I feel</strong> [excited / confused / skeptical / left out / ...] because...</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>I notice</strong> the plan emphasizes [X] but doesn't mention [Y]...</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>I'm confused by</strong> [specific section or claim]...</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>I would ask</strong> [question the plan doesn't answer]...</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>I wish it said</strong> [something missing]...</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h3>Zoom setup</h3>
          <p>Send persona cards via chat (one per breakout room). Teams read and discuss in breakout rooms for 10 minutes, then return to the main room. Each team gets 2 minutes to present their persona's reaction. Capture key themes in a shared doc.</p>

            <h4>Facilitator tips</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Assign people to personas that are <em>different</em> from their real role. The point is to stretch perspective.</li>
              <li>Encourage people to stay in character during the presentation. "As a community member, I..." is more powerful than "a community member might think..."</li>
              <li>The "frontline staff" persona often generates the most honest feedback. People feel freer to voice practical concerns through a character.</li>
              <li>If you can, include one persona who's explicitly skeptical (like the reporter or the new board member). Their outside view is gold.</li>
