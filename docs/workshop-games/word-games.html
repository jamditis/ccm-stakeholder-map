          <p>Teams race to answer questions that can only be answered by searching through the plan. Mix factual lookups, pattern-finding, and reflective questions to force different kinds of reading.</p>

            <h4>Facilitator tips</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Mix easy lookups with harder analysis questions. Early wins build momentum.</li>
              <li>Include at least 2-3 reflective questions. These generate the best discussion.</li>
              <li>The last question should always be "what's missing?" &mdash; it's the most valuable.</li>
              <li>Don't worry about exact right answers. Disagreements between teams are the point.</li>

    <!-- Activity 2: Six-Word Summary -->
    <section class="section" id="six-word">
      <div class="section-label">Activity 2 &middot; 5 minutes</div>
      <h2>Six-word summary</h2>

      <p>Everyone writes a six-word summary of the entire plan. The constraint forces brutal prioritization: with only six words, you can't hedge or waffle. The simultaneous reveal shows where the team is aligned &mdash; and where it isn't.</p>

      <h3>How to run it</h3>
      <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-label">The simultaneous reveal</div>
        <p style="margin: 0;">Tell everyone to type their six-word summary in the Zoom chat (or a shared doc) but <strong>not hit enter yet</strong>. When everyone's ready, count down: "3... 2... 1... send!" All summaries appear at once. This prevents people from anchoring to the first response they see.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Examples</h3>
      <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: var(--text-light);">Show these to your team for inspiration. Good six-word summaries are specific to the plan, not generic.</p>
      <div class="example-grid">
        <div class="example-card">"Grow revenue, deepen reach, measure everything."</div>
        <div class="example-card">"People first, data second, always learning."</div>
        <div class="example-card">"Less meetings, more impact, stay nimble."</div>
        <div class="example-card">"Serve the underserved. Prove it works."</div>
        <div class="example-card">"Build trust slowly. Scale what works."</div>
      </div>

      <h3>Discussion prompts</h3>
      <div class="discussion-prompts">
        <div class="discussion-prompt">Where did summaries overlap? That's likely the plan's clearest message.</div>
        <div class="discussion-prompt">Where did they diverge? That's where the plan might be ambiguous or trying to do too many things.</div>
        <div class="discussion-prompt">Did anyone's summary surprise you? What did they see that you didn't?</div>
        <div class="discussion-prompt">If you had to pick ONE six-word summary for the plan, which would it be?</div>
      </div>

    <!-- Activity 3: Found Poetry -->
    <section class="section" id="found-poetry">
      <div class="section-label">Activity 3 &middot; 10 minutes</div>
      <h2>Found poetry</h2>

      <p>Each person scans the plan and pulls out exactly 15 words or short phrases &mdash; in the order they appear &mdash; to create a "found poem" that captures the plan's essence. The poems reveal what different people see as the core message.</p>

      <h3>The rules</h3>
      <div class="card" style="margin: var(--space-md) 0;">
        <ol style="padding-left: 1.2rem;">
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Exactly 15 words or short phrases</strong> &mdash; no more, no less.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Must appear in order</strong> &mdash; you can skip sections, but you can't rearrange.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Pulled directly from the plan</strong> &mdash; no added words. Only words that appear in the document.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>10 minutes to compose</strong> &mdash; then paste into a shared Google Doc for a simultaneous reveal.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <h3>Example found poem</h3>
      <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: var(--text-light);">This uses generic strategic plan language. Your team's poems will be specific to your actual plan.</p>
      <div class="poem-display">
        community &mdash; growing<br>
        the landscape shifts<br>
        we commit<br>
        to equity, to access<br>
        measurable outcomes<br>
        partnerships that reach<br>
        beyond our walls<br>
        sustainable &mdash; accountable<br>
        together, forward
      </div>

      <h3>Discussion prompts</h3>
      <div class="discussion-prompts">
        <div class="discussion-prompt">Which words or phrases appeared in multiple people's poems? Those are the plan's gravitational center.</div>
        <div class="discussion-prompt">What surprised you about someone else's poem? What did they find important that you skipped over?</div>
        <div class="discussion-prompt">Do the poems make the plan sound inspiring? Or bureaucratic? That's a signal about the plan's language.</div>
