      <h2>Why argue against your own plan?</h2>
      <p>Most planning processes suffer from groupthink. People nod along because they don't want to be the one to raise objections. This game gives people <em>explicit permission</em> to poke holes. By making it a structured exercise rather than open criticism, it feels safe. And the plan comes out stronger.</p>

      <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-label">Set the tone first</div>
        <p style="margin: 0;">Before starting, say this out loud: "Your job is to be the best devil's advocate you can. The harder you argue against the strategy, the more you're helping us. This is not about what you personally believe &mdash; it's about stress-testing the plan."</p>

      <h2>The debate format</h2>

      <div class="activity-layout">
        <div>
          <h3>Before the session</h3>
          <p>Pull 3-4 key strategies or goals from the plan. Each one will be debated. Assign them to teams in advance or during the session.</p>

          <h3>The rounds</h3>
          <p>For each strategy, run one debate round. With 3 strategies, that's about 30 minutes total.</p>

          <div class="debate-columns" style="margin: var(--space-md) 0;">
            <div class="debate-side debate-against">
              <h4 style="color: var(--accent-debate);">Attack team (3 min)</h4>
              <p>Argue why this strategy is flawed, won't work, or is the wrong priority. Be specific: cite what's in the plan, identify gaps, name risks.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; color: var(--text-light);"><strong>Prompt:</strong> "This strategy will fail because..."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="debate-side debate-for">
              <h4 style="color: var(--accent-auction);">Defense team (3 min)</h4>
              <p>Respond to the attacks. Defend the strategy using evidence from the plan. Acknowledge valid concerns. Explain why the strategy is still worth pursuing despite the risks.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; color: var(--text-light);"><strong>Prompt:</strong> "That's a fair concern, but here's why it still works..."</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="card" style="margin: var(--space-md) 0;">
            <h4 style="font-family: 'DM Serif Display', serif;">Then: Group debrief (4 min)</h4>
            <p>Open floor. Which attacks landed? Which were easy to defend against? Were there any concerns the defense couldn't address? Those undefendable concerns are the plan's real weak spots.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Team rotation</h3>
          <p>For each new strategy, rotate roles: the attack team becomes the defense team, and vice versa. This prevents anyone from being typecast and ensures everyone practices both sides.</p>

          <h3>Zoom setup</h3>
          <ol style="padding-left: 1.2rem;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Assign strategies to teams and share via chat or shared doc</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Give teams 5 minutes in breakout rooms to prepare their arguments</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Return to the main room for the debate rounds</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Use the "raise hand" feature or facilitator-called turns to manage speaking</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Have someone capture key points in a shared doc during each round</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

            <h4>Facilitator tips</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Assign the strongest advocates for a strategy to argue <em>against</em> it. They know it best and can generate the sharpest critiques.</li>
              <li>Keep time strictly. 3 minutes per side feels short, which is the point &mdash; it forces people to lead with their strongest argument.</li>
              <li>If a team says "we couldn't find anything to argue against," push harder. Every strategy has risks.</li>
              <li>The debrief is the most valuable part. Don't let the debate rounds eat all the time.</li>
            </ul>

              <li>"The plan says [Y], but there's no plan for when [Z] happens."</li>
              <li>"Who specifically is responsible for this? It's vague."</li>
              <li>"We tried something similar in [year] and it didn't work because..."</li>
